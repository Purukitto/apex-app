## 🎯 What is Apex?

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### The Dark Cockpit

Apex is designed with the rider in mind, especially for use on mobile devices during rides:

- **OLED First**: Pure black backgrounds (`#0A0A0A`) to save battery and reduce glare
- **High Contrast**: White and Apex Green (`#00FF41`) for critical data visibility
- **Instrument Grade**: Monospaced fonts (JetBrains Mono) for telemetry precision
- **Glove-Friendly**: Large touch targets, long-press for destructive actions
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle, high-end transitions for a polished experience
