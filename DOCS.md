# Apex: The Rider's Black Box

## Vision
A minimalist, high-precision utility for motorcyclists. Apex is a "Flight Recorder" for the road and a "Digital Garage" for the machine.

## Design Philosophy: "The Dark Cockpit"
- **OLED First:** Pure black backgrounds (#0A0A0A) to save battery and reduce glare.
- **High Contrast:** White and 'Apex Green' (#00FF41) for critical data.
- **Instrument Grade:** Use monospaced fonts for telemetry.
- **Glove-Friendly:** Large touch targets, long-press for destructive actions.

## Core Pillars
1. **The Garage:** Maintenance logs, bike profiles, service reminders.
2. **The Recorder:** GPS, Lean Angle, G-Force, and Altitude tracking.
3. **The Gearbox:** Mileage tracking for tires, helmets, and chains.
